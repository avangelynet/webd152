    <p>Hello, I'm Avangelyne Turiano. 
        My preferred drink choice is an iced matcha latte with oatmilk, 
        maybe add a shot of espresso if I need that extra boost.
        I used to mainly get regular coffee, but I didn't like that it would
        make my anxiety go through the roof. I've also heard that it's not good
        for your health either, so I've decided to change to tea instead. 
        At first, I didn't like matcha, I always thought that it tasted
        too earthy for my preference, but as time went on, I began to like it more
        and I liked that it didn't make me as anxious as I was before.
